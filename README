NAME
    Class::MakeMethods::Template::ReadMe - About this Module

SYNOPSIS
      package MyObject;
      use Class::MakeMethods::Template::Hash (
        'new'       => 'new',
        'string'    => 'foo',
        'number'    => 'bar',
      );
  
      package main;   
 
      my $obj = MyObject->new( foo => "Foozle", bar => 23 );
      print $obj->foo();
      $obj->bar(42);

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends the Class::MakeMethods framework by providing an
    abstract superclass for extensible code-templating method generators.

    Common types of methods are generalized into template definitions. For
    example, "Template::Generic"'s "new" provides a template for methods
    that create object instances, while "Template::Generic"'s "scalar" is a
    template for methods that allow you to get and set individual scalar
    values.

    Thse definitions are then re-used and modified by various template
    subclasses. For example, the "Template::Hash" subclass supports
    blessed-hash objects, while the "Template::Static" subclass supports
    shared data; each of them includes an appropriate version of the
    "scalar" accessor template for those object types.

    Each template defines one or more behaviors, individual methods which
    can be installed in a calling package, and interfaces, which select from
    those behaviours and indicate the names to install the methods under.

    Each individual meta-method defined by a calling package requires a
    method name, and may optionally include other key-value parameters,
    which can control the operation of some meta-methods.

  Prerequisites

    Requires Class::MakeMethods 1.003.

  Tested Platforms

    This release has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

      5.6.1 on darwin

    You may also review the current test results from CPAN-Testers:

      http://testers.cpan.org/search?request=dist&dist=Class-MakeMethods

VERSION
    This is version 1.003 of Class::MakeMethods::Template.

INSTALLATION
    You should be able to install this module using the CPAN shell
    interface:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::MakeMethods::Template'

    If this module has not yet been posted to your local CPAN mirror, you
    may also retrieve the current distribution from the below address and
    follow the normal "gunzip", "tar xf", "cd", "perl Makefile.PL && make
    test && sudo make install" procedure or your local equivalent:

      http://www.evoscript.org/Class-MakeMethods/

SEE ALSO
    See the Class::MakeMethods manpage for an overview of the framework this
    fits into, and the general calling conventions for "use" and "make".

    See the Class::MakeMethods::Template manpage for discussion of the code
    generation features.

    If you have used Class::MethodMaker, you will note numerous
    similarities. Backward compatibility and conversion documentation is
    provded in the Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker manpage,
    available in a separate distribution on CPAN.
